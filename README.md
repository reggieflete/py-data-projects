# Python Data Project â€“ Luke Barousse Course

This project is part of my learning journey through the Python course by Luke Barousse.  
It's currently a work in progress (WIP), as I continue to apply and expand my Python skills.

The goal of this project is to reinforce key data concepts while building hands-on experience with real Python code.
