Python Data Course â€“ Luke Barousse Course
This project is part of my learning journey through the Python course by Luke Barousse.
It's currently a work in progress (WIP), as I continue to apply and expand my Python skills.

The goal of this project is to reinforce key data concepts while building hands-on experience with real Python code. You can find in the PY_data_course/3.Project_python_course the final project
