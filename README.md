# Python Data Project – Luke Barousse Course

This project is part of my learning journey through the Python course by Luke Barousse.  
It's currently a work in progress (WIP), as I continue to apply and expand my Python skills.

The goal of this project is to reinforce key data concepts while building hands-on experience with real Python code.

# 🐍 Python for Data Analytics – Capstone Project

## 📘 Introduction

This repository showcases the capstone project developed during the “Python for Data Analytics” course by Luke Barousse. The project integrates Python programming with data analysis techniques, culminating in a real-world application that demonstrates the skills acquired throughout the course.

## 🛠️ Background

The course is designed for beginners aiming to delve into data analytics using Python. It covers foundational programming concepts, data manipulation, and visualization techniques. The capstone project serves as a practical application of these concepts, reinforcing learning through hands-on experience.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment.

## 📊 Analysis

The capstone project involves analyzing a dataset to extract meaningful insights. Key steps include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and relationships within the data.
3. **Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to represent data findings.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to interpret data trends.

## 📚 What You Learned
